# Churn-Prediction
An ongoing matter that keeps troubling enterprises is churn rate. 
Churning is the percentage rate at which consumers cancel their subscription from a specific service.
The algorithm proposed is an approach to predict whether a customer will change telecommunications provider for a Kaggle’s private competition.

The training and the test set contain information about 4250 and 750 customers respectively.
The training set contains an additional binary feature, “churn” which describes weather or not the customer has changed provider and is the target variable. An overview of the features is provided in the table below:
